# inside-out

Experiments in mutual recursion. Done in Scheme-6 (Guile 2.0.11).

Exploring mutual recursion and its peculiar relationship to
repeated application of multiple return-value functions.

- Complex powers and multiplication.
- Pauli matrices, successive squaring.
- Fibonacci numbers and higher recursions.

Run the tests like so:

```
$ guile -s test-inside-out.ss
```
